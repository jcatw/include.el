* include.el: simple elisp dependency management
  include.el allows you to easily manage elisp dependencies.  I wrote
  it to keep my config file (kind of) sane.  You might find it useful!

** Example Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (include 'clojure :depends 'slime)
  (include 'slime)

  ...

  (if-included 'slime
    (require 'slime)
    (setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.lisp$" . lisp-mode))
                          auto-mode-alist))
    (setq slime-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
    (slime-setup '(slime-fancy)))

  (if-included 'clojure
    (require 'clojure-mode))

  ...

  (eval-includes)
#+END_SRC
